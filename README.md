# Text_Adventure
This was an assignment for the last period of my first year.

The text adventure was my first project with java. Also it was my first time working with inventories and different type off objects.
I also learned the singleton concept for the first time.

The game is not the best in it's small to no story because I focussed on the programming.

This game was made as a side project during my bigger school projects. The game was developt in about 4 weeks.
